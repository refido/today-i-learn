## Day 1 (17 october 2022)

- Experiences
That day I learned about [zep](https://zep.us/), a website for gathering together, usually called the metaverse. After that, we formed groups and decided on the topic of our project. The experience on that day was fascinating because there were many things to be learned.

- Team project topic
The topic that our group chose was warehousing, containing what items to include, and then being able to add and reduce stock items.

- What I have done so far
brainstorm to choose a topic with the team
learn to make wireframes using Figma

- My goal in this Bootcamp
I want to make my empire...in [zep](https://zep.us/) of course
