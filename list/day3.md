A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day.

## Day 3 (19 october 2022)

- Team progress for today

We have already completed the functions of adding an item, viewing the item function, and deleting the item function. We have also deployed the website in Heroku.

- What I have completed today

I finished my task of displaying data from MongoDB on the website we built.

- New things that I learned / error

I discovered that I can use Bootstrap to manage the layout of my website's interface, the example code is as follows:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row row-cols-2">
    <div class="col">Column</div>
    <div class="col">Column</div>
    <div class="col">Column</div>
    <div class="col">Column</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

This means it will create a layout with two rows and then fill it with columns.

- My reflection

I need to learn more about Bootstrap because it will help me design a good website.
