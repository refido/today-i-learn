Because most of us are new to React, we believe that learning together and sharing information after we have learned it on our own will help us improve our knowledge.

When we do some programming, dividing a layout or function by each folder comes in handy when we need to find a bug, error, or even a logical expectation.

- What did I do well?

- What needs to improve?
