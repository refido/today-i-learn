Today, we created questions and answers, from which we will select one to exchange with another group. Later, we will receive questions from other groups and answer them.

- What did I learn today?

A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a string of characters that is used on the Internet to identify a name or a resource.

A URI is a string that identifies a resource by its location, name or both. URL and URN are two specializations of URI.

A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a subset of a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that specifies where an identified resource can be found and how to access it. A URL specifies how to obtain the resource. It does not have to be an HTTP URL (http://), but it can also begin with ftp:/ or smb:/, indicating the protocol used to obtain the resource.

A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a URI that uses the URN scheme and does not imply that the identified resource is available. URNs (names) and URLs (locators) are both URIs, and the same URI can be both a name and a locator.

- What did I do well?

By far my most familiarity with React is with component layouts.

- What needs to improve?

I need to improve my understanding of how to use functional updates in useState.
