## Day 7 (24 october 2022)

![image](/images/5.jpeg)

- My team goal today

We have at least four tasks to complete as a team, and we will help each other with the parts that we do not yet understand.

- What I have done so far

Completed three tasks as a team, met with the team, and added some features to my personal task.

- My reflection

The clock is ticking and I still have a lot to do.

- The plan for tomorrow

I need to rush through my personal tasks so that I can finish at least two features.
