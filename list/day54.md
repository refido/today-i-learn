Set up a development environment: First, I installed Node.js and created a new React project using the create-react-app tool. This gave me an essential structure for my project and allowed me to start designing my front end.

Created mockups and wireframes: To plan out the look and feel of my front end, I created mockups and wireframes using tools like Figma or Adobe XD. This helped me visualize the layout and design of the site.

Decided on a colour scheme: I chose a colour scheme for my front end that was visually appealing and cohesive. I considered factors like the branding of the site, the target audience, and the overall aesthetic.

Chose typography: I selected font styles and sizes that were easy to read and suited the site's tone. I also made sure to consider how the typography would look on different devices.

Planned out the navigation: I determined the best way to organize the content on my front end and how users would navigate through it. I considered factors like the hierarchy of the content and the layout of the menu.

Tested and iterated: As I designed my front end, I tested it and gathered feedback from users to identify any issues and make improvements.

Overall, designing a front end using React was creative and thought-provoking. I learned a lot about how to create a practical and visually appealing user interface.
