We're almost done with the cloning look and re-creating the page. Some of the back-end features are also nearly finished. We discovered what skills we needed to create our own projects.

- What did I learn today?

Bootstrap's grid system is extremely useful. Rows are wrappers for columns. To control the space between columns, each has horizontal padding (called a gutter). This padding is then offset on rows with negative margins to ensure your column content is visually aligned down the left side. Rows also support modifier classes, which can be used to apply column sizing uniformly, and gutter classes, which can be used to change the spacing of your content.

- What did I do well?

Using col in bootstrap is a good idea. Columns are incredibly adaptable. There are 12 template columns available per row, allowing you to create various combinations of elements that span any number of columns. Column classes indicate the number of template columns to span (e.g., col-4 spans four). Widths are set in percentages so that you always have the same relative sizing.

- What needs to improve?

Using redux and a back-end, or even React, is something I'm very familiar with at the moment, but it can be difficult to implement in a new project. It will be difficult to solve new technical challenges for the first time. Furthermore, we are putting what we have learned into practice by cloning and coding familiar pages.
