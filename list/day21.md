We are about halfway through cloning and recreating the page we like. We discover what skills we will require to create our own projects.

- What did I learn today?

Prepare the wireframe for mobile display as well, and ensure that it is fully responsive to all devices. To retrieve book data, you can also use web scraping or APIs.

- What did I do well?

Try out the CSS framework to help us create layouts faster so we can focus on optimizing app performance with the methods we learned last week.

- What needs to improve?

It will be difficult to complete a new technical challenge that we are attempting for the first time. This week is all about putting what we've learned to use by cloning coding a familiar page.
