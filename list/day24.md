Today, we will present the results of our clone project. When nearly all of the pages have been successfully implemented. Despite the fact that the entire system has not yet been cloned, some components and pages are missing. It's fantastic that each team can showcase their hard work while also learning from one another.

- What did I learn today?

Bootstrap's Checks and radios are very useful. With the help of, the browser's default checkboxes and radio buttons are replaced. form-check is a set of classes for both types of input that improves the layout and behavior of their HTML elements, allowing for more customization and cross-browser consistency. Checkboxes allow you to select one or more options from a list, whereas radio buttons allow you to select one option from a long list.

- What did I do well?

Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to display legible, readable, and appealing written language. Typesetting entails selecting a typeface, point size, line length, line spacing, and letter spacing, as well as adjusting the spacing between letter pairs. This is simple to do with the Bootstrap framework.

- What needs to improve?

It was also a lot of work to style the cloned web to match its appearance. Perhaps I should be more patient when it comes to designing or styling web pages. Even some of the functions that use redux, hooks, and middleware are still a mystery to me.
