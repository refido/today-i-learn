Today we must complete our personal task, and surprisingly, there is also a mini-test that is similar to the personal task we created earlier, but the feature in this mini-test simply adds and displays a list of data. What's difficult is that the time limit for the mini-test is only two hours, which makes me nervous. But, in the end, I was able to solve it.

- What did I learn today?

Working from something we had previously learned made me realize that this is my yardstick for whether or not I understood what I had previously learned, not to mention the time constraint. Here, I realize how important it is to plan ahead of time, such as what I need to do first and what I will do next, not to mention the part that requires a deep understanding before doing the work, which takes a long time. So in the end Time and Work management is important.

- What did I do well?

It makes up for my remaining work time in areas I understand very well, such as component layouts in React, which is a good thing because the remaining time I have available can be used to work on the parts I don't understand.

- What needs to improve?

I need to understand how Map and UseState work better; this is critical because I will use this function frequently, and so on.
