We talked and got to know each other today as part of the new team. Today, we also played a game with all of the bootcampers, which was a lot of fun.

- Experience?

Today was a lot of fun because the game was played with everyone.

- The plan for tomorrow

I want to learn Redux, and there is a lot of Redux material to learn.

- Reflection?

My new teammates are already very experienced in programming; I must emulate them.
