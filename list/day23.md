Meeting a professional in software programming is more enjoyable than I expected. They appear to be a lot of fun, and anyone with a background in informatics can become a good developer. I don't think I'll ever know something unless I try it for myself.

- What did I learn today?

Bootstrap's Checks and radios is extremely useful.Browser default checkboxes and radio buttons are replaced with the help of.form-check, a set of classes for both input types that improves the layout and behavior of their HTML elements, allowing for greater customization and cross-browser consistency. Checkboxes are used to select one or more options from a list, whereas radio buttons are used to select one option from a list of many.

- What did I do well?

Typography is the art and technique of organizing type in order to display written language that is legible, readable, and appealing. Selecting the typeface, point size, line length, line spacing, and letter spacing, as well as adjusting the spacing between letter pairs, constitute typesetting. With the help of the Boostrap framework, this can all be done quite easily.

- What needs to improve?

It was also quite stressful to style the cloned web to match its appearance. Perhaps I need to be more patient when designing or styling web pages.
