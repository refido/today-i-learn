- My team goal today

We have at least three more tasks to complete as a group, and we will assist one another with the parts we do not yet understand.

- What I have done so far

Three more team tasks were completed, and I added some features to my personal task.

- My reflection

The deadline is quickly approaching, and I still have a lot to learn.

- The plan for tomorrow

I need to hurry through my personal tasks so that I can finish them tomorrow.
