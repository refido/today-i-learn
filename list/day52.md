Create an environment for development: First, install Node.js and start a new Node.js project. Then, install Express with the npm package manager.

Create an Express server: In order to create an Express server, we must first create a new file and install the Express module. The Express methods can then be used to define the routes and handle incoming requests.

Define a route: A route in Express is a combination of an HTTP verb (such as GET or POST) and a URL path that specifies how the server should respond to a specific request. The app.METHOD() method, where METHOD is the HTTP verb we want to handle, can be used to define routes.

Handle requests: Once our routes are defined, we can use the app.METHOD() method to specify the function that will be called when a request to that route is made. Typically, this function will perform some action, such as querying a database or generating a response and then returning a response to the client.

Test and debug: It's critical to test and debug our backend on a regular basis to ensure that everything works as expected. You can test our routes and debug any issues using tools like Postman.

Deploy our backend: Once our backend is finished and thoroughly tested, we can deploy it to a hosting service or server so that our front end or other clients can access it.
