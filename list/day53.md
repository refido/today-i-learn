Set up a development environment: First, you will need to install Node.js and create a new React project using the create-react-app tool. This will give you a basic structure for your project and allow you to start building your front-end.

Design your user interface: Next, you will need to decide on the layout and design of your front-end. This will involve creating mockups and wireframes to plan out the look and feel of the site.

Implement your front-end: Once you have a clear idea of how your front-end will look, you can start building it using React components. You will need to create components for the various elements of your site, such as the header, navigation, and main content area.

Connect to a back-end: To add functionality to your front-end, you will need to connect it to a back-end server. This will allow you to retrieve data, such as customer information and transaction records, and display it to the user.

Test and debug: As you build your front-end, it's important to test and debug it regularly to ensure that everything is working as expected. You can use tools like the React Developer Tools browser extension to help you identify and fix any issues.

Deploy your front-end: Once your front-end is complete and fully tested, you can deploy it to a hosting service or server so that it can be accessed by users.
